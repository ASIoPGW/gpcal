	Abstract = {We present an approach to experimentally evaluate gravity gradient noise, a potentially limiting noise source in advanced interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In addition, the method can be used to provide sub-percent calibration in phase and amplitude. Knowledge of calibration to such certainties shall enhance the scientific output of the instruments in the case of an eventual detection of gravitational waves. The method relies on a rotating symmetrical two-body mass, a dynamic gravity field generator (DFG). The placement of the DFG in the proximity of one of the interferometer's suspended test masses generates a change in the local gravitational field detectable with current interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.},
