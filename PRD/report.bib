	Abstract = {A rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) would emit a continuous gravitational wave (GW) detectable by the advanced LIGO, advanced Virgo, KAGRA and proposed third generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET). Such a GW does not propagate freely, but is affected by the Coulomb-type gravitational field of the NS itself. This effect appears as a phase shift in the GW depending on the NS mass. We have shown that mass of an isolated NS can, in principle, be determined if we could detect the continuous GW with two or more frequency modes. Indeed, our Monte Carlo simulations have demonstrated that mass of a NS with its ellipticity 10 --6 at 1 kpc is typically measurable with precision of 20% using the ET, if the NS is precessing or has a pinned superfluid core and emits GWs with once and twice the spin frequencies. After briefly explaining our idea and results, this paper concerns with the effect of misalignment angle (``wobble angle'' in the case of a precessing NS) on the mass measurement precision.},

	Abstract = {A transient gravitational-wave signal, GW150914, was identified in the twin Advanced LIGO detectors on 2015 September 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC. To assess the implications of this discovery, the detectors remained in operation with unchanged configurations over a period of 39 days around the time of the signal. At the detection statistic threshold corresponding to that observed for GW150914, our search of the 16 days of simultaneous two-detector observational data is estimated to have a false-alarm rate (FAR) of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn1.gif] {$\lt 4.9\times {10}^{-6}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} , yielding a p -value for GW150914 of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn2.gif] {$\lt 2\times {10}^{-7}$} . Parameter estimation follow-up on this trigger identifies its source as a binary black hole (BBH) merger with component masses ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn3.gif] {$({m}_{1},{m}_{2})=({36}_{-4}^{+5},{29}_{-4}^{+4})\,{M}_{\odot }$} at redshift ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn4.gif] {$z={0.09}_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$} (median and 90% credible range). Here, we report on the constraints these observations place on the rate of BBH coalescences. Considering only GW150914, assuming that all BBHs in the universe have the same masses and spins as this event, imposing a search FAR threshold of 1 per 100 years, and assuming that the BBH merger rate is constant in the comoving frame, we infer a 90% credible range of merger rates between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn5.gif] {$2\mbox{--}53\,{\mathrm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} (comoving frame). Incorporating all search triggers that pass a much lower threshold while accounting for the uncertainty in the astrophysical origin of each trigger, we estimate a higher rate, ranging from ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn6.gif] {$13\mbox{--}600\,{\mathrm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} depending on assumptions about the BBH mass distribution. All together, our various rate estimates fall in the conservative range ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/833/1/L1/apjlaa4677ieqn7.gif] {$2\mbox{--}600\,{\mathrm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} .},

	Abstract = {We present the result of searches for gravitational waves from 200 pulsars using data from the first observing run of the Advanced LIGO detectors. We find no significant evidence for a gravitational-wave signal from any of these pulsars, but we are able to set the most constraining upper limits yet on their gravitational-wave amplitudes and ellipticities. For eight of these pulsars, our upper limits give bounds that are improvements over the indirect spin-down limit values. For another 32, we are within a factor of 10 of the spin-down limit, and it is likely that some of these will be reachable in future runs of the advanced detector. Taken as a whole, these new results improve on previous limits by more than a factor of two.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a novel two-layer anti-reflection (AR) coating method for large-diameter infrared (IR) filters made of alumina, for use at cryogenic temperatures in millimeter wave measurements. Thermally sprayed mullite and polyimide foam (Skybond Foam) are used as the AR material. An advantage of the Skybond Foam is that the index of refraction is chosen between 1.1 and 1.7 by changing the filling factor. Combination with mullite is suitable for wide-band millimeter wave measurements with sufficient IR cutoff capability. We present the material properties, fabrication of a large-diameter IR filter made of alumina with this AR coating method, and characterizations at cryogenic temperatures. This technology can be applied to a low-temperature receiver system with a large-diameter focal plane for next-generation cosmic microwave background polarization measurements, such as POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2).},

	Abstract = {Precise calibration of kilometer-scale interferometric gravitational wave detectors is crucial for source localization and waveform reconstruction. A technique that uses the radiation pressure of a power-modulated auxiliary laser to induce calibrated displacements of one of the ~10 kg arm cavity mirrors, a so-called photon calibrator , has been demonstrated previously and has recently been implemented on the LIGO detectors. In this paper, we discuss the inherent precision and accuracy of the LIGO photon calibrators and several improvements that have been developed to reduce the estimated voice coil actuator calibration uncertainties to less than 2% (1σ). These improvements include accounting for rotation-induced apparent length variations caused by interferometer and photon calibrator beam centering offsets, absolute laser power measurement using temperature-controlled InGaAs photodetectors mounted on integrating spheres and calibrated by NIST, minimizing errors induced by localized elastic deformation of the mirror surface by using a two-beam configuration with the photon calibrator beams symmetrically displaced about the center of the optic and simultaneously actuating the test mass with voice coil actuators and the photon calibrator to minimize fluctuations caused by the changing interferometer response. The photon calibrator is able to operate in the most sensitive interferometer configuration, and is expected to become a primary calibration method for future gravitational wave searches.},

	Abstract = {We describe three fundamentally different methods we have applied to calibrate the test mass displacement actuators to search for systematic errors in the calibration of the LIGO gravitational-wave detectors. The actuation frequencies tested range from 90 Hz to 1 kHz and the actuation amplitudes range from 10 −6 m to 10 −18 m. For each of the four test mass actuators measured, the weighted mean coefficient over all frequencies for each technique deviates from the average actuation coefficient for all three techniques by less than 4%. This result indicates that systematic errors in the calibration of the responses of the LIGO detectors to differential length variations are within the stated uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry--Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.},

	Abstract = {KAGRA is a 3 km cryogenic interferometric gravitational wave telescope located at an underground site in Japan. In order to achieve its target sensitivity, the relative positions of the mirrors of the interferometer must be finely adjusted with attached actuators. We have developed a model to simulate the length control loops of the KAGRA interferometer with realistic suspension responses and various noises for mirror actuation. Using our model, we have designed the actuation parameters to have sufficient force range to acquire lock as well as to control all the length degrees of freedom without introducing excess noise.},

	Abstract = {Calibration of the second-generation LIGO interferometric gravitational-wave detectors employs a method that uses injected periodic modulations to track and compensate for slow temporal variations in the differential length response of the instruments. These detectors utilize feedback control loops to maintain resonance conditions by suppressing differential arm length variations. We describe how the sensing and actuation functions of these servo loops are parameterized and how the slow variations in these parameters are quantified using the injected modulations. We report the results of applying this method to the LIGO detectors and show that it significantly reduces systematic errors in their calibrated outputs.},

We report on the current status of the project as well as the overview of the main features and the schedule. The construction has been underway since 2012, and the tunnel excavation in the mine for two 3-km arms finished at the end of March 2014. As with the other advanced terrestrial interferometers, KAGRA will have two long Fabry-Perot cavities to sense gravitational waves, but they are to be installed underground for lower seismic noise. KAGRA will be the first large interferometer having cryogenic cavities, the mirrors for which are planned to be cooled down to around 20 K for reducing thermal noise.},

I focus on detecting bursts, i.e. short-duration signals, with optimal coherent data-analysis methods. I show that the polarization-averaged sensitivity of any network of identical detectors to any class of sources can be characterized by two numbers---the visibility distance of the expected source from a single detector and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a confident detection---and one angular function, the antenna pattern of the network. I show that there is a universal probability distribution function (PDF) for detected SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first detected event will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I also derive the universal PDF for detected values of the orbital inclination, taking into account the Malmquist bias; this implies that the number of gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary coalescences should be 3.4 times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction of the gamma burst. Using network antenna patterns, I propose three figures of merit (f.o.m.'s) that characterize the relative performance of different networks. These measure (a) the expected rate of detection by the network and any sub-networks of three or more separated detectors, taking into account the duty cycle of the interferometers, (b) the isotropy of the network antenna pattern, and (c) the accuracy of the network at localizing the positions of events on the sky. I compare various likely and possible networks, based on these f.o.m.'s. Adding any new site to the planned LIGO--VIRGO network can dramatically increase, by factors of 2--4, the detected event rate by allowing coherent data analysis to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident background. Moving one of the LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves direction finding by a factor of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO--VIRGO network not only improves direction finding but will further increase the detection rate over the extra-site gain by factors of almost 2, partly by improving the network duty cycle. Including LCGT, LIGO-Australia, and a detector in India gives a network with position error ellipses a factor of 7 smaller in area and boosts the detected event rate a further 2.4 times above the extra-site gain over the original LIGO--VIRGO network. Enlarged advanced networks could look forward to detecting 300--400 neutron star binary coalescences per year.},

	Abstract = {We present a possible observing scenario for the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors over the next decade, with the intention of providing information to the astronomy community to facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We determine the expected sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals, and study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source. We report our findings for gravitational-wave transients, with particular focus on gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary neutron-star systems, which are considered the most promising for multi-messenger astronomy. The ability to localize the sources of the detected signals depends on the geographical distribution of the detectors and their relative sensitivity, and 90{\%} credible regions can be as large as thousands of square degrees when only two sensitive detectors are operational. Determining the sky position of a significant fraction of detected signals to areas of 5 deg2 to 20 deg2 will require at least three detectors of sensitivity within a factor of ∼ 2 of each other and with a broad frequency bandwidth. Should the third LIGO detector be relocated to India as expected, a significant fraction of gravitational-wave signals will be localized to a few square degrees by gravitational-wave observations alone.},

	Abstract = {We present an approach to experimentally evaluate gravity gradient noise, a potentially limiting noise source in advanced interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In addition, the method can be used to provide sub-percent calibration in phase and amplitude. Knowledge of calibration to such certainties shall enhance the scientific output of the instruments in the case of an eventual detection of gravitational waves. The method relies on a rotating symmetrical two-body mass, a dynamic gravity field generator (DFG). The placement of the DFG in the proximity of one of the interferometer's suspended test masses generates a change in the local gravitational field detectable with current interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.},
